# Dropdown Character Maker

## Learning Objectives

- Use a for/of loop to run a function against every item in an array (i.e., console.log , alert ).
- In response to a user event, add a new item to a state array and display the new state to the user (i.e., add a new todo).
- Use the .value property to get the value of a 'grabbed' HTML form input tag
- Use .createElement() and .append() to display a new HTML tag (with .textContent ) to a grabbed DOM element on click.
- Use .createElement() and .append() to add a list of new DOM  elements to a grabbed DOM element on click
- Create a select element to create a dropdown.
- Use `+` and `${}` to concatenate strings.
- Identify what variables are in a given scope/closure
